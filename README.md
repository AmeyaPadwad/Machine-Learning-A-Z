# 🤖 Machine Learning A–Z

This repository contains hands-on Python implementations of topics from the [Machine Learning A–Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) course by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves on Udemy.

Each concept is implemented in a dedicated Python file for clarity and modular learning.

## 🗂 Structure

Each file corresponds to a specific topic or algorithm from the course.
Each script is self-contained and follows the structure taught in the course:

- Data import & preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation & visualization (where applicable)

---

## 🧰 Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels xgboost
```

## ▶️ How to Run

Each `.py` file can be executed independently. Example:

```bash
python 01_regression.py
```
